## Purpose
This exercise App will allow users to store and track their workout information by connecting to an API. We will be using Handlebars to render the data, and ChartJS to visualize the power exerted by day. This will give users a better understanding of their progress and the ability to review their progress over the course of time. Additionally, the App will have the ability to export the data in a variety of formats, making it easier for users to review and share their progress.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to track my power while at the gym by logging my sets, reps, and weights in a secure and authorized website. I want to be able to see my past workouts, set goals for myself, and get reminders to work out. I want to be able to quickly and easily visualize my progress so that I can stay motivated to reach my goals.

## Concept
Structure 365 is a workout app designed to track your workouts and progress while giving you new personalized workouts everyday. The inspiration to create Structure 365 came from our group member Immanuel, he has been manually tracking his progression of his workouts over the past 4 years and wanted to have a better way to track this data.
