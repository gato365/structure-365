## Purpose
This exercise App will allow users to store and track their workout information by connecting to an API. We will be using Handlebars to render the data, and ChartJS to visualize the power exerted by day. This will give users a better understanding of their progress and the ability to review their progress over the course of time. Additionally, the App will have the ability to export the data in a variety of formats, making it easier for users to review and share their progress.
